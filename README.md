Hi this is a pretty simple application I made using "Bat2Exe" by dehoisted. "https://github.com/dehoisted/Bat2Exe"

For both the mods by Alekos.

It just launches the F13: The Game Mods by Alekos and makes steam compatability with the Steam launcher for the original game work so Steam will track your hours on it and you will also be able to launch the mods from the page for the original game.

It's really easy to create the application to suite your own needs to but for release purposes make sure the mods are installed to The F13: The Game steam folder and then just add one of the release files from here according to which mod you put in that directory. E.g : If you Installed CampForestGreen by Alekos To the Original F13: The Game Folder, add the Exe from the "for_CampForestGreen" folder to that same directory.

If you want to keep this out of the original game directory you could probably edit the bats and just changes the paths in it to work from anywhere on the PC (if you want to say, not move the Mods install into F13: The Game folder but still track hours), though you'd have to remake the exe using "Bat2Exe" Yourself.
